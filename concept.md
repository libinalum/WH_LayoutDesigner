Application Name: RackOptix

Objective: Maximize storage density and accessibility by optimizing racking elevation profiles, aisle spacing, and layout based on product mix, facility constraints, and material handling equipment parameters.

‚∏ª

Key Inputs
	1.	Facility Constraints
	‚Ä¢	Clear height (usable vertical space)
	‚Ä¢	Column spacing/grid
	‚Ä¢	Fire code setbacks / egress paths
	‚Ä¢	Door/dock locations
	‚Ä¢	HVAC, lighting obstructions
	‚Ä¢	Existing rack footprint (optional import)
	2.	Product Data
	‚Ä¢	SKU dimensions (L√óW√óH) and weights
	‚Ä¢	SKU velocity (ABC classification, picks/month)
	‚Ä¢	Storage method preference (pallet, case, tote, each)
	‚Ä¢	Stackability and handling limitations
	‚Ä¢	Environmental requirements (temp zones, flammable, etc.)
	3.	Material Handling Equipment
	‚Ä¢	Forklift reach height
	‚Ä¢	Aisle width requirements
	‚Ä¢	Load/unload clearance
	‚Ä¢	Pick method (case, layer, pallet)
	4.	Operational Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Throughput goals (inbound/outbound volume)
	‚Ä¢	Targeted service level (e.g., fast movers ‚â§5s walk)
	‚Ä¢	Picking method (wave, batch, zone, pick-to-light)

‚∏ª

Core Features
	1.	Elevation Profile Generator
	‚Ä¢	Suggests optimal beam elevations per rack bay based on SKU stack heights and reach truck capabilities
	‚Ä¢	Supports mixed configurations (e.g., double deep, push-back, carton flow at bottom, selective above)
	2.	Aisle Width Optimizer
	‚Ä¢	Calculates optimal aisle widths for each zone based on equipment, velocity, and turning radius
	‚Ä¢	Flags zones that could be converted (e.g., narrow aisle to very narrow aisle with turret trucks)
	3.	Simulation-Driven Layout Evaluator
	‚Ä¢	Creates multiple layout scenarios using:
	‚Ä¢	Different rack types (selective, drive-in, pallet flow, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	SKU re-slotting logic to group by velocity or volume
	‚Ä¢	Simulates picker paths, replenishment flow, and congestion
	4.	SKU-to-Location Assignment Engine
	‚Ä¢	Assigns SKUs to optimal rack zones based on:
	‚Ä¢	Storage requirements
	‚Ä¢	Velocity-based slotting (fast movers lower and near outbound)
	‚Ä¢	Cube-per-order-index (CPOI) heuristics
	5.	3D Visualizer & CAD Export
	‚Ä¢	Interactive view of rack elevations, obstructions, and aisle layouts
	‚Ä¢	Export DXF/DWG/SKP for design review or integration with facility models
	6.	Compliance & Safety Validator
	‚Ä¢	Validates against fire code spacing, seismic requirements, forklift safety clearances, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures minimum pick aisle egress paths and sprinkler head clearance

‚∏ª

Advanced Add-ons (Phase 2)
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Re-slotting Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Periodically updates slotting suggestions based on real-time WMS data (velocity, cube shifts)
	‚Ä¢	Integration with WMS/ERP
	‚Ä¢	Imports real SKU movement and location data
	‚Ä¢	Pushes updated rack configurations or bin assignments
	‚Ä¢	Cost vs Density Tradeoff Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Evaluates cost per pallet position across layout variants
	‚Ä¢	Visualizes impact on labor cost, equipment utilization, and throughput

‚∏ª

Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Python (optimization engine w/ OR-Tools), Node.js (API layer)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + Three.js for 3D layout
	‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (for spatial constraints)

    Here‚Äôs the RackOptix MVP UI/Architecture breakdown including visual mockup plan and component setup for implementation.


‚úÖ RackOptix MVP UI ‚Äì Component Layout

üñ•Ô∏è Main Canvas UI (left side, ~70% width)
	‚Ä¢	2D Draw Canvas (SVG or Canvas)
	‚Ä¢	Grid overlay with snap option
	‚Ä¢	Zoom/pan controls
	‚Ä¢	Click-to-point or prompt-based boundary drawing
	‚Ä¢	Click/drag to draw obstructions
	‚Ä¢	Hover tooltip with coordinates
	‚Ä¢	Layer toggle (boundary, obstructions, future zones/racks)

‚∏ª

üß≠ Side Panel UI (right side, ~30% width)

Step 1: Define Facility Boundary
	‚Ä¢	Button: ‚ÄúStart Boundary‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Sequential prompts:
	‚Ä¢	‚Üí How many feet right?
	‚Ä¢	‚Üë How many feet up?
	‚Ä¢	‚Üê How many feet left?
	‚Ä¢	‚Ä¶until closed loop
	‚Ä¢	Visual: live preview of path
	‚Ä¢	Finish: ‚ÄúClose Polygon‚Äù button to seal shape

Step 2: Add Obstructions
	‚Ä¢	Obstruction type dropdown:
	‚Ä¢	Column, Panel, Dock, HVAC, Custom
	‚Ä¢	Input fields:
	‚Ä¢	X, Y, Width, Depth
	‚Ä¢	Button: ‚ÄúPlace Obstruction‚Äù

Other Controls
	‚Ä¢	Zoom In/Out
	‚Ä¢	Snap to Grid (toggle)
	‚Ä¢	Export JSON
	‚Ä¢	Export DXF (stretch)
	‚Ä¢	Reset / Undo

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Stack Recommendation

Frontend
	‚Ä¢	Framework: React + TypeScript
	‚Ä¢	Canvas Engine:
	‚Ä¢	Use Konva.js for easier object manipulation and layering over HTML5 canvas
	‚Ä¢	Alternatively, SVG with D3 for full control if needed
	‚Ä¢	State Management: Zustand (lightweight, fine-grained)
	‚Ä¢	File Export: json2dxf (if DXF needed), otherwise just store polygon and objects in JSON
